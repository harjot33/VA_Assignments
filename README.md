# Visual Analytics Assignments

Welcome to the Visual Analytics course.

## PIP install and dependencies
To set up your environment, we provided a requirements.txt with all required dependencies. Do NOT use any other dependencies other than the ones listed there.

## How to run the Python Code
In case you are using pycharm, you just need to right click any python file and select `Run 'ScriptName.py'` to run it, however **if you are running the python file from a terminal**, run the following (examples here are in related to assignment1):
* For windows, `cd` into the *assignments1* folder and run `set PYTHONPATH=..\..\ && python ScriptName.py`
* For mac/linux, `cd` into the *assignments1* folder and run `export PYTHONPATH=../../ && python ScriptName.py`

This is due to the normal import pathing python uses. This will ensure that you are able to use code from other folders in your project (e.g. use assignment1 scripts in the assignment2 folder, when time comes).

## We highly recommend you to use vscode or pycharm (remember: as students you have free license), in case you choose one of this: the root folder should be "assignments", the main folder you downloaded from Brightspace.

## How to submit your assignments
Once finished with the implementation of the functions, submit the same .zip you downloaded from Brightspace. Add a README or a description in the submission of how to run your code.
